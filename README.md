# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Practice

This collection of projects is the result of completing various assignments, including practice exercises and homework assignments, throughout an NLP course. These projects provide hands-on experience in exploring a wide range of NLP concepts and topics. Please note that these assignments are intended for educational purposes only and are not suitable for production use.

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1: Text Analysis and Frequency Distributions

The first homework assignment, HW1, focuses on text analysis and frequency distributions. In this assignment, we delve into analyzing text corpora, computing basic statistics, and understanding the frequency of words in different texts. You will explore the following topics:

- Calculating the length of texts.
- Determining the vocabulary size.
- Calculating the lexical diversity.
- Identifying the most common words.
- Analyzing specific word usage.
- And more.

The skills developed in this assignment lay the foundation for understanding text statistics and word frequencies, which are fundamental in NLP.

### Homework 2: Text Tokenization and Regular Expressions

Homework 2, HW2, delves into text tokenization and the use of regular expressions. Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, as it involves breaking text into smaller units, such as words or phrases. This assignment covers the following topics:

- Tokenizing text.
- Using regular expressions to search for patterns.
- Cleaning and preprocessing text data.
- Extracting specific information from text.
- Analyzing text structure.
- And more.

These skills are essential for text processing and feature extraction in NLP applications.

### Homework 3: Language Modeling and Text Generation

HW3 focuses on language modeling and text generation. Language models are central to understanding and generating human language. This assignment includes the following topics:

- Preprocessing text data for modeling.
- Creating language models.
- Generating text using language models.
- Calculating perplexity.
- Evaluating and understanding language generation.
- And more.

By completing this assignment, you will gain insights into language modeling and text generation, which are essential in tasks like chatbots, text completion, and more.

### Homework 4: Sentiment Analysis and Naive Bayes Classification

The fourth assignment, HW4, explores sentiment analysis and Naive Bayes classification. Sentiment analysis is a key NLP application used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in text. This assignment covers the following topics:

- Preprocessing and feature engineering for sentiment analysis.
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Analyzing text sentiment.
- Understanding classification probabilities.
- Identifying informative features.
- And more.

By completing this assignment, you will acquire practical knowledge of sentiment analysis and text classification, which have applications in customer reviews, social media analysis, and more.

## Dependencies

Before working on the assignments, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Having these dependencies in place is essential for running the code successfully.

## Disclaimer

These assignments are meant for practice and learning purposes. Please avoid using the code in production environments or presenting it as a complete NLP solution. The primary goal is to enhance your understanding of NLP concepts.
